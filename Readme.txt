For this project, I've used Java and SQLite Database. This app is a simple calendar with weekly view. 
In weekly view, an user can add, edit or delete events added to calendar. 
For the calendar, I have used recycler view. List of events are shown below the weekly calendar as ListView.
The app keeps all its data saved even after closing and re-opening. 
I have not used Room or Any other libraries as I felt I am more comfortable this way. 
A project can be done in multiple ways and as I did not want to waste too much time in this project, I did it as quickly and efficiently as possible.
